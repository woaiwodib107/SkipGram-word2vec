# SkipGram-word2vec

Hi All!
This week you all will be implementing Skip-Gram Approach for training word vectors (The famous word2vec by Tomas Mikolov). You will be using PTB corpus to train the word vectors. 
This week you will be implementing word2vec in Google Colaboratory. 
Please do use GPU runtime. Google Colab gives access to K80 12GB GPU for a session of 12 hours. Please feel free to experiment with the parameters for which you are not restricted to change.

For this assignment you will need to write the code in Pytorch. I have intentionally kept this assignment easy, because many of the student do not have sufficient know-how of Deep Learning frameworks.
There are two ways for evaluating the obtained word vectors: Intrinsic and Extrinsic. 
In this assignment the vectors have been evaluated using Extrinsic method. Download the polarity data.
